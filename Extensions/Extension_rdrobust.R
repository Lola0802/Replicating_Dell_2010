# REMARK 1â€”Discrete Running Variable: Assumption 1(a) rules out discrete-valued running variables. In applications where Xi exhibits many mass points near the cutoff, this assumption may still give a good approximation and our results might be used in practice. However, when Xi exhibits few mass points, our results do not apply directly without further assumptions and modifications, and other assumptions and inference approaches may be more appropriate; see, for example, Cattaneo, Frandsen, and Titiunik (2014).
